## SUPER ULTIMATE CHALLENGE

Forms are the basis of many mobile applications. In this challenge-based section, youâ€™ll build a form to submit data to a backend system. Plus, there are rewards if you can complete the challenges ðŸ˜€.

<h4 class="exercise-start">
    <b>Exercise</b>: Start up a new app
</h4>

Go ahead and start up a new NativeScript app for this workshop:

```
tns create NativeScriptForms --ng
```

Next, change directories into your new project:

```
cd NativeScriptForms
```

<div class="exercise-end"></div>

To earn a gift card:
  - Allow the user to submit the form with the four fields on the screenshots. Donâ€™t worry how the data is formatted when you send it the backendâ€”just get the thing to submit.

Bonus points:
  - Improve on our very basic design, perhaps using the new NativeScript core theme.
  - Disable the form when you submit.
  - Show an activity indicator while submitting.
  - Show an alert after the form successfully submits.
  - Make all fields mandatory.
