## SUPER ULTIMATE CHALLENGE

It’s the end of the day, therefore you’re more ready than ever for the SUPER MEGA ULTIMATE CHALLENGE. That’s right, get ready to test your NativeScript skills against the biggest and baddest four-field form that we can reaslistically tackle in an hour.

Before we introduce the challenge, let’s get a few of the logical things out of the way.

<h4 class="exercise-start">
    <b>Exercise</b>: Start up a new app
</h4>

Go ahead and start up a new NativeScript app for this workshop:

```
tns create CHALLENGE --ng
```

Next, change directories into your new project:

```
cd CHALLENGE
```

<div class="exercise-end"></div>

To earn a gift card:
  - Allow the user to submit the form with the four fields on the screenshots. Don’t worry how the data is formatted when you send it the backend—just get the thing to submit.

Bonus points:
  - Improve on our very basic design, perhaps using the new NativeScript core theme.
  - Disable the form when you submit.
  - Show an activity indicator while submitting.
  - Show an alert after the form successfully submits.
  - Make all fields mandatory.
